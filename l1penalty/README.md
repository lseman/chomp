### Points for Interpolation

Suppose we have the following four points:

\[
\{(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4)\}
\]

### Newton's Form of the Interpolating Polynomial

Newton's polynomial takes the form:

\[
P(x) = c_0 + c_1(x - x_0) + c_2(x - x_0)(x - x_1) + c_3(x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2)
\]

where \(x_0, x_1, x_2,\) and \(x_3\) are the \(x\) values of the data points, and \(c_0, c_1, c_2,\) and \(c_3\) are the coefficients we need to find.

### Calculating the Coefficients

The coefficients are calculated using divided differences:

1. **\(c_0 = f[x_0] = y_0 = 1\)**

2. **\(c_1 = f[x_0, x_1]\)**
   \[
   f[x_0, x_1] = \frac{f[x_1] - f[x_0]}{x_1 - x_0} = \frac{3 - 1}{1 - 0} = 2
   \]

3. **\(c_2 = f[x_0, x_1, x_2]\)**
   \[
   f[x_0, x_1, x_2] = \frac{f[x_1, x_2] - f[x_0, x_1]}{x_2 - x_0} = \frac{\frac{2 - 3}{2 - 1} - 2}{2 - 0} = \frac{-1 - 2}{2} = -1.5
   \]

4. **\(c_3 = f[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3]\)**
   \[
   f[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3] = \frac{f[x_1, x_2, x_3] - f[x_0, x_1, x_2]}{x_3 - x_0} = \frac{\frac{\frac{4 - 2}{3 - 2} - \frac{2 - 3}{2 - 1}}{3 - 1} - (-1.5)}{3 - 0} = \frac{\frac{2 + 1}{2} + 1.5}{3} = 0.5
   \]

### Constructing the Polynomial

Now, let's put all the pieces together:

\[
P(x) = 1 + 2(x - 0) - 1.5(x - 0)(x - 1) + 0.5(x - 0)(x - 1)(x - 2)
\]

This polynomial can be simplified and expressed in standard form, but Newton's form is especially convenient for evaluating \(P(x)\) at any \(x\) and for adding additional points.

### Conclusion

This polynomial \(P(x)\) will pass through all four given points and represents the cubic polynomial fit using Newton's divided difference interpolation method. It allows for efficient computation and extension to higher degrees by adding more terms and calculating further divided differences without recomputing the entire polynomial.

### Steps for Normalizing and Orthogonalizing Polynomial Basis Functions

1. **Initialization**: 
   You start with a set of polynomial basis functions \(\{N̄_i(·)\}_{i=1}^p\), which can initially be simple monomials (like \{1, x, x^2, ..., x^n\}) or any other set of polynomials.

2. **Normalization**: 
   Each basis polynomial \(N̄_i(x)\) is normalized such that its value at a specific point \(y_i\) is 1. This is done by dividing the polynomial by its value at \(y_i\):
   \[
   N_i(x) = \frac{N̄_i(x)}{N̄_i(y_i)}
   \]
   This step ensures that each polynomial \(N_i(x)\) has a unit value at its corresponding point, similar to setting the magnitude of a vector to 1 in the vector space context.

3. **Orthogonalization**: 
   Each polynomial \(N̄_j(x)\) for \(j > i\) is then adjusted to ensure it is zero at the point \(y_i\), which is the point corresponding to \(N_i(x)\). This is done by subtracting from \(N̄_j(x)\) a suitable multiple of \(N_i(x)\):
   \[
   N̄_j(x) = N̄_j(x) - N̄_j(y_i)N_i(x)
   \]
   This step is similar to the orthogonalization step in Gram-Schmidt, where each vector is made orthogonal to the previously normalized vectors. Here, each polynomial is made orthogonal in the sense that its value is zero at the points corresponding to all previously normalized polynomials.

4. **Final Assignment**:
   After normalization and orthogonalization, the updated polynomial \(N̄_i(x)\) is then set as the new \(N_i(x)\) for further use or for constructing the interpolating polynomial.

### Example

Assuming a very simple example where we start with a basic set of monomials \(\{1, x, x^2\}\) and interpolation points \(Y = \{0, 1, 2\}\), the procedure would look something like this:

- **Normalize \(N_1(x) = 1\)**:
  \[
  N_1(x) = 1 \quad \text{(already normalized as it's value at 0 is 1)}
  \]

- **Orthogonalize \(N_2(x) = x\) and \(N_3(x) = x^2\) at point 0**:
  \[
  N_2(x) = x - x(0) \cdot 1 = x
  \]
  \[
  N_3(x) = x^2 - x^2(0) \cdot 1 = x^2
  \]

- **Normalize \(N_2(x) = x\) at point 1**:
  \[
  N_2(x) = \frac{x}{x(1)} = x
  \]

- **Orthogonalize \(N_3(x) = x^2\) at point 1**:
  \[
  N_3(x) = x^2 - x^2(1) \cdot x = x^2 - x
  \]

- **Normalize \(N_3(x) = x^2 - x\) at point 2**:
  \[
  N_3(x) = \frac{x^2 - x}{(x^2 - x)(2)} = \frac{x^2 - x}{2}
  \]

Through this process, the polynomials \(N_i(x)\) become tailored for interpolation over the specific points, ensuring that each polynomial contributes only at its designated interpolation point and is zero at all others. This makes the resulting polynomial interpolation well-posed and stable, especially for numerical computations.
